# Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) - Dashboard and Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project provides insights into the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)** dataset, which explores the sensitivity of various cancer types to specific drugs. The dataset enables analysis of drug efficacy, cancer treatment effectiveness, and pathway sensitivities. The Power BI dashboard visualizes key aspects, offering actionable insights for understanding cancer drug responses.

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes information on:
- **Cancer Type**: Type of cancer being analyzed.
- **Drug Name**: Name of the drug used in the treatment.
- **Target Pathway**: The biological pathway targeted by the drug.
- **LN_IC50**: Logarithmic value of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, a measure of drug sensitivity.
- **AUC**: Area Under the Curve, representing the drug's effectiveness.
- **MSI Status**: Microsatellite Instability Status (e.g., MSI-H or MSI-L).
- **Gene Expression**: Expression level of specific genes in response to drug treatment.
- **Screening Medium**: Medium used for screening drug effectiveness.
- **Drug Type**: Classification or type of the drug.
- **COSMIC ID**: Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer ID.
- **First Gene Expression**: Expression value of the first gene recorded in the dataset.
- **Average AUC**: Average effectiveness of the drug.
- **Average LN_IC50**: Average sensitivity of the drug.
- **Comparative Drug Efficacy**: Comparative effectiveness of drugs across different screening mediums.
- **Consistency Across Mediums**: Consistency of drug efficacy across various screening environments.

## Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the GDSC dataset through the following visualizations:
- **Top 10 Drugs by LN_IC50 Impacting Pathway Sensitivity**: Identifies drugs with the highest sensitivity impact on specific pathways.
- **AUC Trends**: Evaluates trends in drug effectiveness across cancer types.
- **Comparative Drug Efficacy and Consistency Across Mediums**: Shows drug consistency and effectiveness across different screening environments.
- **Drug Efficacy Gauge Chart**: Measures overall drug efficacy.
- **Cancer-Specific Analysis**: Provides insights into drug sensitivity based on cancer type and pathway.

## Usage
This project is beneficial for researchers and healthcare professionals aiming to understand and compare drug responses across different cancer types, helping in the development of targeted cancer treatments.
